# Intelligent-gym
Project mainly focuses on safely reopening of gym. During covid-19 pandemic gyms have been closed for long time which casted its effect on people by drastically reducing there health and immunity .


It provides a complete safety system for gyms starting from checking whether the customers have a mask at the entrance as well as inside the gym. It will also check whether the customers are following the social distancing norms inside the gyms by calculating the distance of each customer from everyone else and highlights in red if they are not. Many countries have also imposed a restriction on the number of customers inside the gym at a given time. This maintains the count of all the customers inside the gym. The number of staff members also have to be reduced so this implies they wont be able to monitor the gym activities properly so we have made a fall detection system which will help monitor the safety of the customers even when the gym trainers are outside the exercise area . This provides a complete solution to the challenge posed by Covid on opening of gyms.
